Three posts! Can you believe it?

As I mentioned, we can all contribute to these projects if we can find them. The act of contributing is part of the act of helping create a better world. We all have what I call a _creative practice_ where we decide what we want to create and we do it.

By create, I'm talking in the largest possible sense. We create all kinds of things every day, including our relationships with other people, food, good or bad feelings in others, and much more. Like the concept of an open artifacts project, a creative practice just makes explicit what we are already doing it, and making it explicit allows us to examine what we're doing and find ways to improve it.

So, pay attention to your creative practice and work toward ensuring that the world you're creating is the one you want to live in.
