In a very real way, open artifacts projects are already out in the wild. This is not a new concept except that I think it gives a name to something that people were already moving toward.

I think one of the first goals would be to find as many of these existing open artifacts projects and let other people know about them. I can only do so much of this kind of thing, and I would appreciate anyone else lending a hand. In true open artifacts spirit, this website is an open artifacts project designed to gather and disseminate information about open artifacts projects.

Let's call it the Great Search for Open Artifacts! Join us in the search and help highlight projects that we can all contribute to.
