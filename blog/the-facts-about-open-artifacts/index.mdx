This is my first post. I'm not sure what to write about, but the idea of creating open artifacts projects has been on my mind, so I thought I'd start with that.

Open Artifacts are, at their core, websites that describe in great detail how to create something: an artifact. That artifact could be a clay pot or it could be an early-education school. Beyond the website, there needs to be some way for people to contribute ideas or other work to benefit the project.

The idea is to

1. Make the information available so that anyone in the world can create it.
2. Create a collaborative space in which everyone who wants to can contribute to the project.

**Yay Open Artifacts!**
