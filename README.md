# My Gatsby Portfolio

This site started as the Gatsby tutorial, and then I decided to keep going and make it into a clone of my [previous portfolio website](https://github.com/jimappleg8/jims-portfolio) that I had built in Jekyll.

I really enjoy working with Gatsby and React, and I had a lot of fun putting this together.
